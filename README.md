# DLAN Android application

The decentralized network sharing solution.

### 1. How to run

Run the code in Android Studio. Look for official documentations for how to do that.

### 2. Configurations

If you follow strictly all instructions in all 3 repos (dlan-android, dlan-operator and dlan-network), the only thing that needs modification is the `serverAddr` in MainActivity.java. Change it to `http://<ip address of the server machine>`.
